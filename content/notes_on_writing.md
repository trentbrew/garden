# Brevity is a writing app I'm building. It's designed to help non-writers effectively express themselves.

**The aim of Brevity is to reduce the friction of writing and help the writer express themselves more effectively. This is achieved through a combination of AI-powered suggestions, novel UX features, and a focus on simplicity, clarity, and user control.**

1. *Writing the Truth is Hard*: Early drafts are rough approximations to the truth. Achieving clarity and truthfulness requires extensive revising and a commitment to making each sentence sharper and more believable.

> In order to help make the writer's work sharper and more believable, Brevity will provide AI-powered suggestions for improving clarity, truthfulness, and believability. This will be achieved through a combination of grammar and style suggestions, as well as AI-generated inline suggestions and background research agents that can provide additional context and information to support the writer's claims. Writing, whether for self-reflection or for others, is a pursuit of understanding and sharing truth, aiming to persuade and engage by making ideas clear, beautiful, and valuable.

2. *Good Writing is Good Psychology*: Writing effectively involves understanding the relationship between the reader and the text. This means building a psychology of reading where every rule or advice serves to enhance this relationship.

> Brevity's UX and AI features will be paramount in enhancing the relationship between the writer and the text. This will be achieved through a focus on simplicity, clarity, and user control, as well as AI-powered features that adapt to the writer's unique style and ethos. Good design, rooted in psychology, aims to smooth the writing process by making Brevity's AI a reflective tool that enhances the writer's relationship with their text, ensuring control, understanding, and support.

3. *Beware of Using Unfamiliar Words*: Words not used in regular speech can alienate readers unless their use is carefully justified and serves the reader's understanding.

> Brevity will suggest alternative words or phrases when the writer uses unfamiliar or overly complex language. This will help ensure that the writing is accessible and engaging for a wide audience. While writing aims to communicate ideas clearly, art embraces the expression of feelings and experiences beyond words, often welcoming diverse interpretations.

4. *Clarity of Purpose*: A well-written piece has a clear, singular purpose. Everything in the writing, including digressions, should serve this overarching goal.

> Before writing, Brevity will prompt the writer to define the purpose of their piece. This will help ensure that the writing is focused and effective, with every sentence serving the overarching goal. Having a clear, singular purpose in both writing and verbal communication is crucial for understanding and being understood, though it may feel like an unnatural attempt to control the narrative, it's essential for effective information transfer without sacrificing the writer's unique style and ethos.

5. *Question of Purpose*: A compelling answer to what the book or essay is about is crucial. Lack of a clear, overriding purpose can make the piece feel aimless.

> Brevity will prompt the writer to answer the question of what their piece is about. This will help ensure that the writing is focused and engaging, with a clear, overriding purpose.

6. *Occam's Razor for Writing*: Simpler, shorter passages are usually better because they tend to be clearer and more vivid.

> Occam's Razor is a principle that suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the best. Brevity will encourage the writer to keep their writing simple, short, and vivid. This will help ensure that the writing is engaging and effective, with every word serving a clear purpose. The aim is to minimize assumptions, increase clarity, and encourage [[Economy in Thought]].

7. *Hemingway's Advice*: Start writing by finding one true sentence you believe in, and proceed from there. Also, stop writing when you still know what happens next, so you're never stuck. This technique involves ending your writing session at a point where you are clear about the immediate next steps in your narrative or argument, rather than at a point where you've exhausted all your ideas or reached a natural stopping point.

> Before writing, Brevity will prompt the writer to input one true sentence they believe in. The AI will then help the writer proceed from there, providing suggestions and feedback to ensure that the writing is engaging and effective. Brevity will help the user gauge when to stop writing with: (1) A subtle visual indicator (progress bar) that changes color as the user approaches the suggested stopping point based on patterns in their writing behavior such as typing speed, pauses, corrections, diminishing quality of writing, achievement of pre-set goals, repetition of ideas, time of day, hours on the platform, etc, (2) Conclusive inline suggestions, (3) Suble visual cues throughout

8. *Exploring Beyond Boundaries*: Sometimes, exploring topics or ideas outside the initial purpose is necessary. This requires understanding how it fits into the overall purpose of your piece.

> Brevity will help the writer think outside the box and explore topics that may relate back to the overall purpose of their piece. This help the writer maintain focus and clarity, while also encouraging creativity and originality.

9. *Title and Chapter Title Considerations*: Effective titles often juxtapose unexpected concepts or are striking and memorable. Chapter titles should also reflect the content and purpose of the chapters.

> Brevity will provide AI-powered suggestions for improving the title and chapter titles of the writer's piece.

10. *Opening Sentences*: The first sentence should engage the reader immediately, starting as late as possible in the story or argument to maintain interest.

> Brevity will place a strong emphasis on the opening sentence, providing AI-powered suggestions for improving the opening sentence of the writer's piece.

11. *Danger Words and Phrases*: Words like "interesting," "quite," and "very" are often overused and can weaken prose. They should be used sparingly or replaced with more precise language.

> Brevity will provide suggestions and visual indicators to help the writer identify and replace danger words and phrases in their writing.

12. *Structure and Classic Style*: Classic style is a form of writing that emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and directness. It is characterized by a focus on the subject matter, a clear and engaging narrative, and a commitment to truthfulness and believability. Classic style is often associated with the work of authors such as George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Effective structure and adherence to classic style can enhance clarity and engagement. However, personal exploration and understanding of the subject matter are necessary before attempting classic style.

> Brevity will adopt the style of the user. The user may choose to write in a classic style, or they may choose to write in a more personal style. Brevity will provide AI-powered suggestions and feedback to help the writer achieve their desired style and ethos.

13. *Avoiding Cliches*: Writers should strive to avoid conventional stories and cliches, seeking original expressions and perspectives to provide fresh insights and engage readers.

> Brevity will place a strong emphasis on avoiding cliches, providing AI-powered suggestions and feedback to help the writer achieve original expressions and perspectives.

14. *Note-taking and Prefaces*: Effective note-taking and thoughtful prefaces can significantly contribute to the writing process, providing clarity and context for the reader.

> Brevity will provide a bi-drectionally linked note-taking feature and a preface feature to help the writer organize their thoughts as they write. This feature will be designed to be simple, non-intrusive, easily accessible, and highly customizable. It is an open-ended multimodal tool that can be used in a variety of ways to support the writer's unique style and ethos.

# Further suggestions:

1. *Minimalistic Interface*: Like a blank canvas, the app should present a clean, uncluttered workspace that minimizes distractions and focuses on the act of creation.

2. *Natural Language Interaction*: Incorporating AI that understands and responds to natural language can provide an experience similar to conversing with a supportive friend.

3. *Suggestion and Autocomplete*: Just as lines in a drawing can flow from one to the next, AI-powered suggestions for words or phrases could help writers build sentences fluidly.

4. *Dynamic Feedback*: Just as artists step back to view their work, writers could benefit from non-intrusive, real-time feedback that's sensitive to their style and intentions.

5. *Visual Mapping of Ideas*: To mirror the interconnected nature of doodles, a feature to visually map out and connect ideas could make organizing thoughts more intuitive.

6. *Customization Options*: Personalizing the app's tools and options can cater to the unique style of each writer, similar to an artist choosing their palette.

7. *Gestural Controls*: If possible, incorporating touch and gesture interactions for editing and organizing could make the writing process more tactile and engaging.

8. *Emotion & Tone Analysis*: Leveraging AI to gauge the emotional tone of the text can help writers ensure their intended message is being communicated.

9. *Adaptive Learning*: The more the app is used, the more it could learn the writer's preferences and quirks, offering better, more personalized suggestions over time.

10. *Bi-Directional Note-Taking*: Linking notes and main text dynamically so that changes in one are reflected in the other can simplify the revision and organization process.
