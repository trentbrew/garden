Hi, I'm Trent. This is my garden. It's a place for me to capture, collect, cultivate, compartmentalize, and connect my thoughts.

I don’t write often, and this feels bizzare. Writing feels odd. Words feel elusive. It’s easy for the pipe of my mind to get clogged by the toilet paper that is English.

Maybe writing is hard because I’m [trying to paint with the backside of the brush](/pencils-paint).

Maybe [words are for information, not emotion](/words-are-for-information).

Maybe I’m just [not a writer](/not-a-writer).

But I’m trying to write more. I’m trying to write better. I’m trying to write more often. I’m trying to write more honestly.

My thoughts are not words.

It takes a lot of effort to turn them into words. Especially the coheret kind.

I hope this can be a space for me to practice that.

Q: ```
What do you currently use to discover, create, and share ideas?
```

A: ```
# Discover

New ideas tend to find me in moments of play, whether it be through doodling, having a conversation, researching an interesting topic, solving a challenging puzzle, watching a movie, or exploring a new place. Inspiration is everywhere and curiosity is my compass.

# Create

I find myself tight-roping between structured notes (Notion/Markdown) and free-form idea generation (pencil + sketchbook) – The latter tends to be more effective for me, but the former is more accessible and shareable. I'm trying to find a balance between the two.

# Share

I've opened the door to sharing my thoughts through a digital garden on my website (trentbrew.com), but the writing process is still a bit of a mystery to me. I'm trying to write more often, more honestly, and more coherently. My thoughts tend to be a bit of a mess, so I'm trying to clean them up and share them with the world.

I've explored tools like Roam Research, Obsidian, Kosmik, Anytype, Logseq, and others, but I'm still trying to find a system that works for me.
