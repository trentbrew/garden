Hello Sane Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Founding Engineer (Senior Fullstack) position at Sane.

My name is Trent Brew. I'm a full-stack engineer with a passion for design and building products that empower people to create, connect, and learn. I have a strong background in web development, a keen eye for design, and a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and creativity.

My cozy corner of the web can be found here: trentbrew.com

Tools for thought and digital gardens are a topic that I'm deeply passionate about, and I believe that Sane's mission to reimagine how we create, capture, connect, and cultivate ideas is both innovative and inspiring. Play is a fundamental part of my creative process, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to a platform that encourages curiosity, exploration, and the sharing of ideas in a more dynamic and integrated way than traditional blogging / knowledge management.

I'm eager to learn more about the role and how I can contribute to Sane's mission. I recently requested early access and would love to experience the platform firsthand to better understand the product and how I can add value to the team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Trent Brew
